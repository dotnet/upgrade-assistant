# Contributing

One of the easiest ways for you to contribute is to participate in discussions on GitHub issues. Right now, pull requests are not being accepted. The team has plans to open up the repository for contributions soon and will have a list of areas that will be up for grabs/need help. Check back in the coming weeks!

## General feedback and discussions?
