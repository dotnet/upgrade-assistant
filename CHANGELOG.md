### Fixed
- VB projects that have a MyType property that requires Windows will now default to net5.0-windows [#529](https://github.com/dotnet/upgrade-assistant/pull/529)

- Updated the ApiController upgrade code fix provider to upgrade to Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ControllerBase instead of Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Controller [#534](https://github.com/dotnet/upgrade-assistant/pull/534)
